*Elaine*, painted by Toby Edward Rosenthal in 1874, depicts a character from the legend of King Arthur and the Kights of the Round Table. She has died of a broken heart,  and in death holds a love letter over her heart. Her body is unnaturally lit compared to the darkness of the boat, the figure steering the vessel that is clothed in black, and the shadowy landscape and waters. Even in death, her purity and beauty remain, and her light continues to shine. The poignant painting inspired a deep public interest in the character of Elaine. The striking sadness of her death and somber funerary-like procession over the water are evident in the composition.
